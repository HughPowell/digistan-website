This site is run by and for the {PROJ} Community, used to develop the {PROJ} specifications, and track the status of {PROJ} implementation and use.

This site, its legal policies, graphics, templates, and framework contents were derived from the http://spec.digistan.org template developed by the [http://www.digistan.org Digital Standards Organization] (Digistan), which aims to promote grass-roots standardization projects, by providing reusable patterns and tools.  If you want help on a standardization project, contact desk@digistan.org.

The site is powered and hosted by [http://www.wikidot.com Wikidot.com], an open source platform for collaborative wikis.  Using Wikidot makes it possible to build the right structures quickly.

The goals of this site are social, and technical.  The social goals are:

# To build an expert community around {PROJ}
# To produce small, cheap, provable pieces of work
# To offer a visible, rapid, and economic process
# To allow anyone to walk-up and contribute

And the technical goals are:

# To provide a space for stability
# To provide a space for experimentation
# To grow free and open specifications
# To allow these to become formal standards
