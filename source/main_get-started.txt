++ Who this site is for

www.{PROJ}.org is a tool for anyone interested in this domain to extend, improve, or build on {PROJ}.  It is meant to be transparent, easy to use, fast, simple.  This site is a way for people to work together to make specifications.

++ Consensus, not authority

COSS - the consensus-oriented specification system is explained [http://www.digistan.org/spec:1/coss here].  This is a specification for how we collaborate on this site.

++ How this site works

The site is open to anyone who accepts the [[[main:intellectual property policy]]].  There is a minimum of formality.  Anyone can contribute ideas and specifications.  Every contributor keeps their copyrights but grants a license to everyone else, under the GPLv3.  Specifications are considered to be "source code".

We don't use formal reviews.  Each spec has one editor, who makes all changes and defines the spec's [[[spec:1|status]]] (raw, draft, stable, etc.)

[[[main:Discussion]]] happens informally via email, wiki, irc, or comments on the site.  Contributors can work in public or in private as they like.  Most discussion happens on the [[[main:discussion | mailing list]]].

We use //forking// to rejuvenate old specs, change editors, or resolve conflict over design choices.  Forking means taking an existing spec text, and creating a new instance.  Unlike most standards projects, we like being able to fork.

Specifications are numbered and higher numbers mean "experimental" while lower numbers mean "stable".

The only significance that a spec has is the number of people who implement it.  The website will track and show this, at a later stage, and if {PROJ} becomes successful.

++ How to register

Read the the [[[main:terms of use]]] and [[[main:intellectual property policy]]], then [[[main:registration|register on-line]]].  If you're an employee or work at a university, get //written// permission to contribute to this site, as for any open source project.

++ What else?

The operators of the site may, in situations of conflict, intervene to ensure a smooth process.  If you are a regular contributor you may be invited to become a moderator or operator.
